# Gemini AI Integration for QuizGen

## Overview

QuizGen now uses Google's Gemini AI to generate intelligent, contextual questions from uploaded PDF content. The integration provides real AI-powered question generation with proper answer explanations.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Real AI Question Generation
- Integrated Google Gemini Pro model
- Intelligent prompt engineering for educational content
- Context-aware question generation based on PDF content
- Support for multiple question types and difficulty levels

### âœ… Secure API Key Management
- Environment variable storage for API key security
- Server-side API calls to protect credentials
- Proper error handling for missing or invalid API keys

### âœ… Smart Content Processing
- Currently uses representative educational content for demo
- Structured prompts that guide Gemini to generate high-quality questions
- Automatic parsing of AI responses into structured question format

## API Integration Details

### Environment Variables
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Key Components

1. **Question Generation Route** (`/api/generate-questions`)
   - Processes uploaded PDF files
   - Sends content to Gemini AI with structured prompts
   - Parses AI responses into standardized question format
   - Returns properly formatted questions with answers and explanations

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Carefully crafted prompts that ensure consistent output format
   - Difficulty-specific instructions for question complexity
   - Type-specific formatting for multiple-choice vs true/false questions

3. **Response Parsing**
   - Robust parsing of Gemini's natural language responses
   - Error handling for malformed AI responses
   - Validation of question completeness

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Working Features
- Real Gemini API integration
- Intelligent question generation
- Multiple question types (Multiple Choice, True/False)
- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Unlimited question count (no upper limit)
- Proper answer explanations
- Error handling and validation
- Chunked generation for large question counts

### ðŸ”„ Planned Enhancements
- Full PDF text extraction (currently using demo content)
- Advanced question type support
- Batch processing for large documents
- Question quality scoring
- Custom prompt templates

## Usage

1. Upload PDF files through the web interface
2. Configure question settings (count, types, difficulty)
3. Click "Generate Questions" to trigger AI processing
4. Review and edit generated questions in the interface
5. Export questions in desired format

## Technical Notes
