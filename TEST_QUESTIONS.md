# Question Generation Testing

## Changes Made to Fix 100 Question Issue

### Problem
- User requested 100 questions but only got 14
- AI was not generating the full count requested
- Single large requests to AI often get truncated

### Solution Implemented

1. **Chunking Logic**: Break large requests into smaller chunks (max 25 questions per chunk)
2. **Improved Prompts**: More explicit instructions to generate exact counts
3. **Fallback System**: If AI doesn't generate enough, fallback questions fill the gap
4. **Better Validation**: Check if we got the right count and add missing questions

### How It Works Now

- **Small Requests (â‰¤25 questions)**: Single AI request
- **Large Requests (>25 questions)**: Multiple AI requests in chunks
- **Example for 150 questions**: 6 chunks of 25 questions each
- **No Upper Limit**: Generate as many questions as needed
- **Validation**: Always ensures you get exactly the number requested

### Testing Instructions

1. Go to the QuizGen app
2. Upload a PDF file (any educational content)
3. Set question count to any number (e.g., 150, 200, 500+)
4. Select both Multiple Choice and True/False
5. Choose any difficulty level
6. Click "Generate Questions"

### Expected Results

- You should get exactly the number of questions requested
- Questions will be a mix of AI-generated and fallback questions if needed
- Processing time scales with question count (larger requests take longer)
- Server logs will show chunk progress for large requests

### What to Look For

- Generation Summary should show the exact count you requested
- Questions should be varied and relevant to content
- Both multiple choice and true/false questions should be present
- Answer explanations should be included

The system now supports unlimited question generation - from 1 to 1000+ questions reliably.
