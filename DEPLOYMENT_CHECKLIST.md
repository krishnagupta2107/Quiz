# Netlify Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Configuration Files
- [x] `netlify.toml` - Properly configured with functions and redirects
- [x] `netlify/functions/api.ts` - Clean, efficient Netlify function with all required endpoints
- [x] `package.json` - Includes `@netlify/functions` dependency
- [x] `vite.config.ts` - Production-ready build configuration
- [x] `env.example` - Environment variables template

## ‚úÖ Build Configuration
- [x] Build command: `npm run build:client`
- [x] Publish directory: `dist/spa`
- [x] Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

## ‚úÖ API Routes
- [x] `/api/ping` - Health check endpoint
- [x] `/api/demo` - Demo endpoint
- [x] `/api/test-questions` - Test questions endpoint
- [x] `/api/generate-questions` - PDF processing endpoint (mock implementation)
- [x] Proper error handling for 404 and 500 errors

## ‚úÖ Client-Side Compatibility
- [x] All API calls use relative paths (no hardcoded localhost URLs)
- [x] SPA routing configured for React Router
- [x] Build process optimized for production

## ‚úÖ Redirects
- [x] API routes redirect to Netlify functions
- [x] SPA routing with fallback to index.html

## üöÄ Deployment Steps
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Set build command: `npm run build:client`
4. Set publish directory: `dist/spa`
5. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard (optional)
6. Deploy!

## üîß Environment Variables
- **Required**: None (all have defaults)
- **Optional**: 
  - `PING_MESSAGE` - Custom message for ping endpoint
  - `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` - For future PDF processing integration
  - `GOOGLE_AI_MODEL` - AI model selection
  - Various app configuration options

## üìù Important Notes
- **PDF Processing**: Currently returns mock data since Netlify functions can't process large files
- **Production Integration**: For real PDF processing, integrate with external services (Google AI, etc.)
- **Function Limits**: Netlify functions have execution time and memory limits
- **Build Process**: Only builds client-side code (functions deployed separately)
- **Environment Variables**: Use `env.example` as template, set in Netlify dashboard

## üéØ Ready for Deployment!
Your app is now configured for successful Netlify deployment with:
- Clean, lightweight Netlify functions
- Proper API routing and error handling
- SPA-compatible build configuration
- No localhost dependencies
- Environment variables properly documented
